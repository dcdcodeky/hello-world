# Code Kentucky pre-work assignment 1
This repository is the first step of my [CodeKentucky](https://codekentucky.org/) pre-work.

## About Me
I'm Dan. I like problem-solving and critical thinking. Between that and growing up playing games on the NES and SNES, I've always had a love for technology. Growing up, I've always wanted to make my own games as a creative outlet and learn something new in general. In middle school, I made several, poorly designed, pen and paper games as a substitute for not being able to make my own.
I still want to me games now, but being over 30, I want to be able to use those problem solving skills as part of a career. I look forward to what might be on the horizon.

### Hobbies
While I love games and problem solving, I do have other hobbies. Such as:
- Hiking/Backpacking
- Kayaking
- Bowling
- Capturing the night sky with my GoPro

Here's my last one night sky capture:
